## Compile with gcc

-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.3.0_1/bin/gcc-6
-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/local/Cellar/gcc/6.3.0_1/bin/g++-6

## Notes

Have had to use a custom deleter for shared_ptr in Vertex clas - so that if a
pointer is deleted, then the Vertex object doensn't get deleted

add/remove neighbours_ in Vertex class private so can only add/remove edges.

BipartiteGraph protected variables/methods so freely used by Biclique

Many prinintg methods used for testing, ideally should have used Google Mock,
but too much hassle
